# MicroThisAndMicroThat
Welcome to the repository for my ***Micro This and Micro That*** article series in **Full Circle Magazine** (https://fullcirclemagazine.org/)

The article series is about Microcontrollers, MicroPython and CircuitPython.

Here you will find code, schematics and more from the articles.

I have started this repository in March 2021.

The code for each article will be in it's own folder.
