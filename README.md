# MicroThisAndMicroThat
Welcome to the repository for my Micro This and Micro That article series in **Full Circle Magazine** (fullcirclemagazine.org)

The article series is about Microcontrollers, MicroPython and CircuitPython.

Here you will find code from the articles.

I have started this repository in March.

The code for each article will be in it's own folder.
